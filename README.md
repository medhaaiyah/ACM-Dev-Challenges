# ACM-Dev-Challenges

In order to be a developer/dev officer I have to be able to achieve three challenges - http://acm-dev-challenge.surge.sh/. Below I have detailed the process that I took for each Challenge.

# Challenge # 1

The first challenge wanted my to create a git hub repository and wanted there to be three folders (one for each challenge). The first challenge was meant to check if I was able to understand how to use the basic features in Git Hub. Within the Challenge 1 folder, I had to create a README that included my name.

# Challenge # 2

The second challenge wanted me to call an API with one query-string parameter called value to pass your name as the argument. I ran this query with two different approaches. The first approach is by creating a php script where I initialize and then execute. The second approach is by creating a bash script.

# Challenge # 3

The third challenge wanted me to click on a button to get a secret code. The issue was that when it went to view a secret code, it would automatically reload to a page saying along the lines that it is unable to access and to retry. After looking at this, I realized that the issue was that it would automatically reload. The solution for this issue is to stop it from automatically reloading. Below are the steps I used to reload

1. Go to Settings > Internet Options
2. Go to Security
3. Click on "custom level" button
4. Disable - "Allow Meta Refresh"
5. Click okay
